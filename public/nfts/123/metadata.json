  "description": "Andrea Dionigi | Collection #2 Farming\n\nA sketch that would like to be shaped by the artist like a piece of clay. The twisted lines of the drawing seem to take strange and peculiar shapes under the effort of the hands, which squeeze and push them towards a form. A desperate cry of a blocked artist with no more ideas who even goes as far as violence in order to get the work done.",
