  "description": "@buda\n\nCollection #1 - Drop 1\n\nI represented the moment in which a person feels overwhelmed by a thousand problems and cannot achieve what he wants, because the goal seems increasingly distant, and stuck in a whirlwind of fears,\nHowever, fears that have their own meaning and are therefore part of daily life, and however much they are scary and an obstacle, they still make you grow mentally.
