  "description": "Farming Edition - Christmas 2021 | Alessandro Nalli\n\nFrom the collection \"Through the looking glass\".\nAlice, six months after her trip to Wonderland wonders, dozing in her living room, what's through the looking glass. I, looking at some of my pictures, wonder what is beyond what is immediately visible. And if I tried to go through the images, what would happen?\nLike in a natural kaleidoscope, I immerse myself in what for me is a journey. And I hope for you as well.",
